					OAuth API Access
				</h1>
				<p>To access the api with a bot, create a token</p>

				<p>API requests are throttled per user and not per token 60 requests per minute. You may have as many tokens as you'd like, however requests from a particular user after 60 will be rejected. Please do not long poll this API. Tokens that long poll will be revoked and access to Personal Access Tokens will be revoked</p>

				<p>Once a token is created, the Zip Code Student Portal can be accessed by passing the token to the headers of an http request.</p>

METHOD: GET
HOST: https://portal.zipcode.rocks
PATH: /api/students
HEAD:
